# Create an F5 iRule that routes HTTP requests to different pools based on the client's IP address and the request URI. The rule should check if the client is in a specific data group, and if the URI contains certain patterns like "/cf/", "/hf/", or "/vh/". Use a switch statement to efficiently handle the routing logic, with a default pool for unmatched cases.
