# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that handles HTTP requests for multiple country-specific domains. The rule should check the requested host domain and URI path to determine appropriate routing. For the EU domain, redirect the root path to a specific index page and route all other paths to an EU-specific pool. For the Belgium domain, redirect the root path to the EU domain with a country-specific path and route all other paths to a Belgium-specific pool. For Netherlands, France (with or without www), and Luxembourg domains, redirect all requests to the EU domain with country-specific paths. This rule provides centralized management of multi-country domain routing and redirection.
