# Create an F5 iRule that routes HTTP traffic to different pools based on the request path. The iRule should convert the path to lowercase, send requests starting with "/devicepairingstage" to a staging pool with debug logging of the URI and client IP, send requests starting with "/devicepairing" to a production pool with URI logging, and allow all other paths to continue with normal processing. Enable performance timing for monitoring.
