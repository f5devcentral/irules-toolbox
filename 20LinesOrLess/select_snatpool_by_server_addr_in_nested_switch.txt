# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that dynamically selects different SNAT pools based on destination server addresses and client IP addresses. The rule should check the selected server's IP address, then examine the client's IP address to determine the appropriate SNAT pool, with special handling for a specific test client and fallback to automap for unspecified servers.
