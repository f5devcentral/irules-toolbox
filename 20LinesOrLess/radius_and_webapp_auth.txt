# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that handles the completion of an access policy. The rule should retrieve the username from the access session data, create a JavaScript snippet for automatic form submission, and respond to the client with a 200 OK status containing this JavaScript. This iRule is part of an authentication flow, possibly integrating RADIUS authentication with a web application.
