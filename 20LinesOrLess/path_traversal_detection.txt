# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule to detect and prevent potential path traversal attacks in HTTP requests. The rule should check the query string for suspicious patterns, log details of potential attacks for debugging purposes, and reject any requests that appear to be attempting path traversal. Include a debug flag that can be easily enabled or disabled.

    # Initialize DEBUG variable to 1 (true) for logging purposes
