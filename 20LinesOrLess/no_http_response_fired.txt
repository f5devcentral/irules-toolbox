# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that routes incoming HTTP requests to a specified APM virtual server and adds an HSTS header to all HTTP responses. The rule should have high priority for both request and response handling. For the HSTS header, set it to be valid for one year, include subdomains, and allow preloading.

    # Route the request to the specified APM (Access Policy Manager) virtual server

    # Add a Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header to the HTTP response
    # This header instructs the browser to only connect to the site using HTTPS in the future
    # max-age: how long the browser should remember to use HTTPS (1 year in seconds)
    # includeSubdomains: apply this rule to all subdomains of the current domain
    # preload: allow the domain to be included in browsers' preload lists
