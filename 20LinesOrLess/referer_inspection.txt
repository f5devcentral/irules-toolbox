# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that implements referrer-based access control for your website content. The rule should check the Referer header of incoming HTTP requests and handle them differently based on the source. Allow requests from specific approved websites to proceed normally. For requests with empty Referer headers, return an empty 200 OK response and log the client's IP address. For requests from any other referrers, redirect the client back to the site they came from and log both the blocked referrer and client IP address.
