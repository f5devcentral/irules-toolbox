# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that manages SSL processing and connection routing based on the incoming port. The rule should run when a client connection is accepted. It should disable ssl processing by default. It should handle different scenarios: for port 80, take no special action; for port 443, enable SSL processing; and for all other ports, forward the connection to a specific IP address while maintaining the original port number.
