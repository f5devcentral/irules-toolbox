# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that implements a tiered rate shaping policy based on client IP addresses. The rule should run when a client connection is accepted. It should check the client's IP against three different user classes: gold, silver, and lump_o_coal. Apply different rate shaping policies for each class: 10Mbps for gold, 512Kbps for silver, and 128Kbps for lump_o_coal users. If the client's IP doesn't match any of these classes, the connection should be dropped.
