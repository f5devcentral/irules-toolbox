# Create an F5 iRule that routes HTTP requests to specific backend nodes based on URI content. The iRule should use case-insensitive pattern matching to check if the URI contains "hypplanning" or "drmservice", and direct matching requests to the appropriate node with specific IP addresses, interfaces, and ports.
