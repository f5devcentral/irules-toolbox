# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that controls access to intranet pages. The rule should allow internal IP addresses to access all pages. For external IP addresses, it should check if they're trying to access specific intranet pages by examining the URL. If an external IP tries to access a protected intranet page, the request should be dropped and logged. Otherwise, allow the request to proceed.
