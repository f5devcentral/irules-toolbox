# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that selectively redirects clients based on their request path, query string, and User-Agent header. The rule should only process requests for the root path, ignore requests with a query string starting with "user=example", and redirect clients with "example" in their User-Agent header to example.com.

    # If it does, exit the rule without redirecting
    if { ([string tolower [HTTP::query]] starts_with "user=example") } {
