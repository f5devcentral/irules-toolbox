# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that enforces HTTPS connections and directs users to a login page. The rule should check if the connection is encrypted by attempting to get the SSL cipher version. For unencrypted connections, log the detection and redirect to the HTTPS version of the Login.jsp page. For encrypted connections, allow the request to proceed but redirect requests for the root path to the Login.jsp page. Include error handling for the SSL cipher check and extract the hostname without port number when constructing redirect URLs.

    # Try to get the SSL cipher version and catch any errors
    # This checks if the connection is encrypted (SSL/TLS)

        # Log that we detected an unencrypted request
        log local0. "\: $result. Redirecting unencrypted request."
