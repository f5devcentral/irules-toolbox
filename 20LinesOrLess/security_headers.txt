# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that enforces web security best practices by redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS and adding essential security headers to responses. The rule should implement HSTS, HPKP, XSS protection, frame options, content type options, and content security policy headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities and attacks.
