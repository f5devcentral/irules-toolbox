# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that enhances security by removing HTTP response headers that could reveal sensitive information. The rule should strip the Server header to hide web server details, remove the Date header to prevent server time disclosure, and eliminate all custom X- headers that might expose implementation specifics.
