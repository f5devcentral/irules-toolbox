# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that inspects decrypted SSL traffic for a specific pattern. The rule should collect SSL payload data, check if it contains the text "the query string", log a message when the pattern is found, release the SSL buffer to allow normal processing, and continue collecting data if the pattern isn't found.
