# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that selectively enforces HTTPS for specific URI patterns. The rule should only process requests on port 80, log connection information, check if the requested URI matches patterns in a "secure_uris" data group, and redirect matching requests to HTTPS while allowing non-matching URIs to continue using HTTP.
