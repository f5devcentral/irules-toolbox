# Create an F5 iRule that modifies file download behavior based on URL parameters. The iRule should capture the query string during the HTTP request, check for an "attachment=1" parameter, and modify the Content-Disposition response header by replacing "inline" with "attachment" when present, forcing browsers to download files instead of displaying them inline.
