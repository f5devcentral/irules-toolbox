# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that identifies and rate-limits high-bandwidth connections. The rule should run when the server sends data. It should check the age of the connection and the amount of data transferred from the server. If a connection has been active for more than 10 seconds and has transferred more than 3MB of data, apply a rate class called "bandHog" and log the client as a bandwidth hog. The rule should also log connection details for all requests, including client IP, port, connection age, and bytes transferred.

when SERVER_DATA priority 500 {
    # Get the age of the current connection in milliseconds
    set srvAge [IP::stats age]
    # Get the number of bytes received from the server
    set srvBytes [IP::stats bytes in]

    # Check if the connection has been active for more than 10 seconds
    # Note: You can adjust this value (10000ms) as needed
    if { $srvAge > 10000 } {
        # Check if the server has sent more than 3MB of data
        # Note: You can adjust this threshold (3000000 bytes) as needed
        if { $srvBytes > 3000000 } {
            # Apply rate limiting to this connection
            # Note: Make sure to create the "bandHog" rate class beforehand
            rateclass bandHog
            # Log a message identifying this client as a bandwidth hog
            log local0. "Bandwidth Hog: [IP::client_addr] server bytes $srvBytes"
