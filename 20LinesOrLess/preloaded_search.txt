# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that rewrites incoming HTTP requests to redirect them to a Yahoo search. The rule should replace the host header with "www.yahoo.com" and modify the URI to "/search?q=" followed by the original requested hostname. This will effectively turn any request into a Yahoo search for the original domain name.

when HTTP_REQUEST priority 500 {
    # Rewrite the host header to www.yahoo.com and the
    # uri to /search?q=$host where $host is the originally requested hostname
