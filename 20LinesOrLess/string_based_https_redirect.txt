# Create an F5 iRule that redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS except for specific alumni paths. The iRule should convert the URI to lowercase and allow HTTP access for any paths containing "*alumni/giving/gift/", "*alumni/giving/pledge/", "*alumni/directory/search.aspx", or "*alumni/directory/update.aspx" using glob pattern matching. All other paths should receive a 301 redirect to the same hostname and URI but with HTTPS protocol.
