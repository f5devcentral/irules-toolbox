# Create an F5 iRule that restricts access to the "/down.php" URI based on client IP address. The iRule should log all incoming requests, check if the URI contains "/down.php", and reject connections from any IP address not in the 75.66.12.0/24 or 15.150.0.0/16 subnets. When blocking access, log the attempt, disable all further events, and reject the connection.
