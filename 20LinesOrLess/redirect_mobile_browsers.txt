# Create an F5 BIG-IP iRule that detects and redirects mobile browsers visiting a specific section of a website. The rule should check if the requested URL starts with a particular domain and path, then examine the User-Agent header to identify common mobile platforms like BlackBerry, iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone. When a mobile device is detected, redirect the user to a mobile-optimized version of the site. The rule should use case-insensitive matching for both the URL and User-Agent checks.

when HTTP_REQUEST priority 500 {
    # Check if the request is for the specific section of the website
    # Convert host and path to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    if { [string tolower [HTTP::host][HTTP::path]] starts_with "www.example.com/section" } {
        # Check the User-Agent header against known mobile browser patterns
        # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
        switch -glob -- [string tolower [HTTP::header User-Agent]] {
